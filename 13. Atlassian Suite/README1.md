## DevOps Interview: Atlassian Suite Questions

---

### Jira

**1. How do you integrate Jira with CI/CD tools for better DevOps workflows?**
   
   - *Possible Answer:* Jira provides out-of-the-box integrations with popular CI/CD tools. For instance, using webhooks, one can notify Jenkins or another CI server about changes in Jira, triggering a build or other jobs. Plugins like Jira Jenkins plugin can be used to display build information directly in Jira.

**2. How do you handle sprint planning and backlog prioritization in Jira?**

   - *Possible Answer:* Jira's agile features, like boards, allow for easy sprint planning. Backlog prioritization can be done using drag-and-drop, and the sprint planning meeting can make use of the "Sprint Planning" mode to assign tasks to a particular sprint.

### Confluence

**3. How do you ensure documentation in Confluence remains up-to-date in a DevOps environment?**

   - *Possible Answer:* By integrating Confluence with tools like Jira, updates to projects or issues can automatically reflect in associated documentation. Moreover, using Confluence's "Page Review" feature, reminders can be set to review and update pages periodically.

**4. Describe how you've used Confluence templates in a project.**

   - *Possible Answer:* Confluence templates can be used to maintain consistency across documentation. For instance, for every new service or component developed, a standard template can ensure that all necessary details (like architecture, dependencies, etc.) are documented consistently.

### Bitbucket

**5. How do you enforce code quality checks in Bitbucket repositories?**

   - *Possible Answer:* Bitbucket pipelines can be utilized to enforce CI checks. Furthermore, integrating with tools like SonarQube can ensure code quality. Pull request policies can be set to ensure that code doesn't get merged unless it passes the defined quality checks.

**6. Explain the process of setting up Bitbucket pipelines for a project.**

   - *Possible Answer:* Bitbucket pipelines require a `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` file in the root of the repository. This YAML file defines the build pipeline steps. It can be set up to define various stages, like build, test, and deploy, and can be integrated with various tools and environments.

### General Atlassian Suite  AB

**7. How do you handle user access and permissions across the Atlassian suite to ensure security?**

   - *Possible Answer:* Atlassian products support user groups and roles. By creating specific user groups (like developers, testers, admins), permissions can be assigned at group levels. Fine-grained permissions can be set at the project or repository level. Also, integration with identity providers using SAML or OAuth can centralize user management.
