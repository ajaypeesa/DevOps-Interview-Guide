1. What is a container? How is it different from a virtual machine?

**Answer:**

A **container** is a lightweight, stand-alone, executable software package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings. Containers are isolated from each other and the host system. They run consistently across various computing environments, ensuring that the application behaves the same way regardless of where it's deployed.

**Differences between Containers and Virtual Machines (VMs):**

- **Isolation Level:** 
  - **Containers:** Share the host system's OS kernel, but package the application and its dependencies. This makes them lightweight.
  - **VMs:** Run a full-fledged OS stack and emulate virtual hardware, making them heavier than containers.

- **Size:** 
  - **Containers:** Typically MBs in size, ensuring quick start-up.
  - **VMs:** Can be GBs in size, leading to slower boot-up times.

- **Performance:** 
  - **Containers:** Since they share the host OS kernel, there's less overhead, and they often exhibit better performance.
  - **VMs:** Introduce additional overhead due to virtualization.

- **Management:** 
  - **Containers:** Managed by container orchestration tools like Kubernetes or Docker Swarm.
  - **VMs:** Managed by hypervisors like VMware or Hyper-V.

2. What is Docker? Describe its architecture.

**Answer:**

**Docker** is a platform used to develop, ship, and run applications inside containers. Docker makes it easy to package and distribute applications, along with their dependencies, in a predictable environment.

**Docker Architecture Components:**

- **Docker Daemon (`dockerd`):** Listens for Docker API requests and can communicate with other Docker daemons.

- **Docker CLI:** The command-line interface that allows users to interact with Docker.

- **Docker Image:** A lightweight, stand-alone package that contains everything needed to run a piece of software. It acts as a template to create containers.

- **Docker Container:** A runtime instance of a Docker image.

- **Docker Registry:** A place where Docker images are stored. Docker Hub and Docker Cloud are public registries, but you can also have private ones.

- **Docker Compose:** A tool to define and manage multi-container Docker applications using YAML files.

The architecture operates on a client-server model. The Docker client communicates with the Docker daemon, which does the heavy lifting of building, running, and managing Docker containers. They can run on the same host or different hosts.
